_2:00PM:_ Honestly I don't really know what to write for this one. It's getting kinda hard to think of things to say in these. Last night I did not get to play any Gran Turismo, I had to go over to my mom's friends house to meet the three dogs, cat, and lizard I will be taking care of this weekend while I house sit. They let the lizard loose in the house and just let her wander around, which I don't think I am totally cool with. Something about that lizard sneaking up on me gives me the heebie jeebies a little. Hopefully I will actually get to play Gran Turismo tonight, if the ps4 doesn't take thirty hours to install the game. I think I got it to install over night last night but I didn't have a chanve to actually check this morning. I did get my new phone yesterday which is exciting. I took have a phone that has a working microphone for granted, and it's very freeing to be able to answer and make calls without my airpods. Honestly, I just need a few more words for this journal entry to be over. So close to two hundred words, hopefully that was enough. Hey, it was!
