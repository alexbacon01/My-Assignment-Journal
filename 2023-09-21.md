_8:00PM:_ What a journey I have been on in the last two hours. As you may recall from my earlier journal entries this week I broke my phone, this truned out to be a big issue when I needed to access learn at home. My only way of using the authenticator was through my phone, and so I spent the last two hours trying to get into my red river account, and also my git hub account which needed to be verified by my school email. I  learnt a very important lesson about ensuring I have back ups to authenticating my logins. Now I have the option to authenticate through a phone call if needed. You may be wondering how I managed to get in at all, and it was by a pure miracle. Out of sheer desperation I tried to get my old phone that broke this week to turn on, and for some blessed and mysterious reason it did. I am slightly disappointed that it worked as it now means I didn't need to go buy a new phone, even though I spent hours trying to get it to work on monday. However, I am thrilled it gave me the opportunity to get into my account. It's also great not having glass shards fall out at me while using my phone.
