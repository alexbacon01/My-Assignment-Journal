_12:53PM:_ My phone unfortunately was not ready to be picked up yesterday but it is today which is great news. Even better news is that the copy of Gran Turismo Sport I ordered on Amazon arrived today and I am very excited to go home and start installing it. I've already warned my girlfriend that she might not hear from me for a few days and not to worry. Also getting a haircut today and it will be nice not having hair in my eyes all the time, and will hopefully improve my Gran Tursimo skills. I have been playing a lot of Forza but have heard Gran Turismo is a better game for using a wheel and also has a better grind. Excited to try it out, was going to get the newest game (Lewis Hamilton is in it which made me want it even more), but I figured I should buy the cheaper previous game and see how I like it first. It still has a very active player base so I think it will be a perfect intro to the series to see if I enjoy it. If I become the next Jann Mardenborough this diary entry will be a nice thing to look back at!
