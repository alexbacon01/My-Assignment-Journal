_9:00AM:_ Today I woke up and my phone had stopped working. (Or did it...?) To be fair, it was a long time coming. This summer I was in a change room and stepped on my pants, crushing my phone in the pocket. The face ID stopped working, but other than that seemed to be okay (ignoring the pieces of tiny glass that kept falling off and getting embedded in my finger). I was pushing it off trying to wait until my contract was up, but unfortunately that didn't work out. A couple months ago the microphone stopped working and I could no longer make phone calls, but this was still manageable. As long as I had my airpods my phone was usable and I could still make phone calls. I woke up today though, miracously on time as my alarm didn't go off. I tried to turn my phone on but was faced with complete disappointment in the black screen that wouldn't wake up. Thankfully my mom had an extra reliable Iphone 8, which I have popped my sim card into and will hopefully hold me over until Rogers is ready for me to pickup the iPhone 14 I ordered online this morning.
